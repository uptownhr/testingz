# Start
`http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=`



# IDs
Now, you have to set the IDs you want to receive. Every stock, index or currency has their own ID. If you want to get values of more than one ID, separate them with ","

You also have to convert special characters into the correct [URL format](http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/html/topics/urlencoding.htm)

# Properties
For the different property tags look at the property list. Use the tag f.

I will use here the tags of name(n), symbol(s), the latest value(l1), open(o) and the close value of the last trading day(p)
